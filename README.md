Z. Cai, Y. Yin, Y. Wang, G. Gui and J. Sha, "Receiver-Agnostic Radio Frequency Fingerprinting via Domain-Invariant Feature Learning," \emph{IEEE Commun. Lett.}, doi: 10.1109/LCOMM.2025.3598034.

We propose a receiver-agnostic RFF framework that enhances generalization by learning domain-invariant features through a dual-perspective feature extraction strategy. Specifically, Fourier phase information is leveraged for its semantic stability and robustness to domain shifts. A knowledge distillation framework is introduced to extract intra-domain invariant features from the phase component, ensuring feature consistency within each receiver. In addition, a cross-domain correlation alignment mechanism is employed to capture shared representations across receivers, thereby improving robustness to distributional variations.
